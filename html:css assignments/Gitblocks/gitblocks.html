                <h2> What is Git?</h2>
                <p> Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots
                    (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshot you build out a
                    whole application, seeing the growth of a full app.
                    During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous
                    snapshots you took or merge those experiments into the your app.
                </p>
                <h2> What is GitHub?</h2>
                <p> GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects form anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>
